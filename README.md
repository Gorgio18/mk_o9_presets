# mk_o9_presets - Omnia.9 presets

You can find different Omnia.9 presets I made in this repository. Most of the presets are made for HD Radio (unless specified otherwise).

They have all been created with *_a lot of_* loudness in mind. They are using factory presets as a starting point (Reference Settings and others...).

### Presets List

* Fillmore Bass : Dense, very loud, yet very punchy!
 * FM (Normal), HD (Normal), HD (Aggressive), HD (aacPlus optimized)
* Red Toasty : Loud and very airy, very consistent sound.
 * HD (Normal)
* Orange Bridge : Loud and airy sound, yet retaining dynamics and punch.
 * HD (Normal) 
* Blue Strike : Powerful, yet more relaxed sound than previous presets listed here
 * HD (Normal)
