# mk_o9_presets - Omnia.9 presets

You can find different Omnia.9 presets I made in this repository. Most of the presets are made for HD Radio (unless specified otherwise).

They have all been created with *_a lot of_* loudness in mind. They are using factory presets as a starting point (Reference Settings and others...).

### Presets List

* Fillmore Bass : Very dense, very loud, yet very punchy! 
 * As the name implies, it focus on giving a powerful low-end sound.
   * FM (Standard), HD (Standard), HD (Aggressive), HD (aacPlus optimized)
* Red Toasty : Loud and very airy, very consistent sound.
 * HD (Standard)
* Orange Bridge : Loud and airy sound, yet retaining dynamics and punch.
 * HD (Standard) 
* Blue Strike : Dense.
 * HD (Standard)
